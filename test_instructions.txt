# Instructions:
Write a Python code for scoring the provided "db.fasta" file sequences according to the following criteria:

Residue	Score
A	10
R	9
N	8
D	7
C	6
Q	5
E	4
G	3
H	2
I	1
L	-1
K	-2
M	-3
F	-4
P	-5
S	-6
T	-7
W	-8
Y	-9
V	-10
X	0

(look on the internet what fasta files are in case you are not familiar with them)
The Python script output must be a text file with four columns: The Sequence_Identifiers, the Sequence_Length in residues, the Total_Score and The Mean_Score (Total_Score/Length).
The lines must be sorted according to the Mean_Score, from highest to lowest value.
As an output example, the file db.fasta.score is provided. The Mean_Score must have a precision between 3 and 5 decimals.
